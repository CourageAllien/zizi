            A free tool that solves a real problem your ideal client has right
            before they'd hire someone like you. They use it, they get value,
            they see your thinking — and by the time they reach out, they
            already trust you.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's not a gimmick. It's how the best in your space are quietly

          </p>
          <p>
            The only problem? Building the right tool — one that actually
            reflects your methodology and converts — used to take a development
            team and months of time.
